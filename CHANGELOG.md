## v0.2.7 [2021-03-18]
_Bug fixes_
* Multiregion queries should take region quals into account for 'get' calls. [#78](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/78))

## v0.2.6 [2021-03-18]
_re-tagged after pushing missing commit_

## v0.2.5 [2021-03-18]
_What's new_
* Improve the hcl diagnostic to error message conversion to improve parse failure messages.  [#72](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/72))

## v0.2.4 [2021-03-16]
_What's new_
* Include key column information in GetSchema response to support dynamic path key generation. [#57](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/57))
* Make get calls with 'in' clauses asynchronous. [#30](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/30))
* Remove need to call StreamLeafListItem for parent-child list calls. The child list function can now just cal StreamListItem. [#64](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/64))
* For parent-child list calls, store the parent list call results in RowData `ParentItem` property so they can be accessed by hydrate functions. [#65](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/65))

_Bug fixes_
* Queries with 'in' clause now work for list calls with required key columns. [#61](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/61))
* For Get or List calls with required key columns and 'in' clauses, incorrect quals are passed to hydrate calls. [#69](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/69))

## v0.2.3 [2021-03-02]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix failure of Get calls which use `ItemFromKey` to provide a hydrate item. [#53](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/53))

## v0.2.2 [2021-02-24]
_What's new?_
* Set the ulimit for plugin processes, respecting env var STEAMPIPE_ULIMIT.  [#43](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/43))
* When displaying hcl errors, show the context if available.  [#48](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/48))
* Only show concurrency summary if there is any summary data to show. [#47](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/47))

* Add support for connection config. ([#21](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/21))
* Add mechanism to limit max hydrate function concurrency. ([#12](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/12))
* Update environment variables to use STEAMPIPE prefix. ([#32](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/32))
