## v4.1.5 [2022-08-26]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix connection cache SetWithTtl. ([#399](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/399))

## v4.1.3 [2022-08-26]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix timeout waiting for pending cached item - if pending item has error, all queries waiting for that pending item now return error rather than rerunning the query. ([#396](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/396))

## v4.1.2 [2022-08-25]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix queries sometimes hanging when multiple scans are accessing the cache. ([#391](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/391))

## v4.1.1 [2022-08-24]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix concurrent map access crash for Plugin.connectionCacheMap. ([#389](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/389))

## v4.1.0 [2022-08-24]
_What's new_
* Add `Plugin` property`ConnectionConfigChangedFunc`. This is a callback function invoked when the connection config changes. The default implementation clears the connection cache and query cache for the changed connection. ([#387](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/387))

## v4.0.2 [2022-08-22]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix `Get` calls stalling due to an attempt to write to an unbuffered channel. ([#382](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/382))

## v4.0.1 [2022-08-11]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix UpdateConnectionConfigs not setting the connection config. ([#375](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/375))
* Fix query results with zero rows not being cached, leading to timeouts and failure to load pending cache results. ([#372](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/372))
* Fix duplicate results returned from cache. ([#371](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/371))
* Remove max concurrent row semaphore. Max concurrent row limiting is disabled by default, and under certain circumstances has been seen to cause a NRE. Removed for now until more detailed benchmarking can be done to justify re-adding. ([#369](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/369))
* Fix parent-child listing, which was broken in v4.0.x  ([#378](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/378))

## v4.0.0 [2022-08-04]
_What's new_
* A single plugin instance now supports multiple connections, as opposed to an instance being created per connection. ([#365](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/365))
* Memory usage has been substantially reduced, particularly when streaming high row counts. ([#366](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/366))
* Allow control of maximum cache memory usage. ([#302](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/302))
* `QueryData` functions `StreamListItem` and `StreamLeafListItem` are now variadic, and accept multiple items to passed in a single call, simplifying the streaming of a page of data. ([#341](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/341))

_Breaking changes_
* Go version updated to 1.19
* `Plugin` property `TableMapFunc` has changed signature. This is the function which is called for plugins with dynamic schema to return their table schema. Note that the parameter `connection` has been added.
  This may be used in place of the removed `Plugin.Connection` property.

The new signature is:
```
func(ctx context.Context, connection *Connection) (map[string]*Table, error)
```


* `Plugin` properties `Connection`, and `Schema` have been removed, and new property `ConnectionMap` added.  
  This is a map of `ConnectionData` objects, keyed by connection. This is needed as each plugin instance may support multiple connections.
  `ConnectionData` looks as follows
``` // ConnectionData is the data stored by the plugin which is connection dependent
type ConnectionData struct {
	// TableMap is a map of all the tables in the plugin, keyed by the table name
	TableMap map[string]*Table
	// connection this plugin is instantiated for
	Connection *Connection
	// schema - this may be connection specific for dynamic schemas
	Schema map[string]*proto.TableSchema
}
```
* `ConnectionManager` has been renamed to `ConnectionCache`. As the plugin can support multiple connections,
  each connection has its own `ConnectionCache`,  which is a wrapper round an single underlying connection data cache.

NOTE: the property `QueryData.ConnectionManager` has been retained for comptibility reasons - this will be deprecated in a future version

## v3.3.2  [2022-07-11]
_What's new_
* Add `MaxConcurrency` to `GetConfig` - for use when using the `Get` hydrate as a column hydrate function. ([#353](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/353))

## v3.2.0  [2022-05-20]
_What's new_
* Deprecate `ShouldIgnoreError` and `ShouldRetryError`. 

  Add instead `ShouldRetryErrorFunc` and a new `IgnoreConfig` containing `ShouldIgnoreErrorFunc`. 

  These functions receive as args the context, QueryData and HydrateData to allow access to connection config and other context data. ([#261](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/261))

_Bug fixes_
* Fix potential transform function casting errors caused by empty hydrate items. If no hydrate data is available, do not call transform functions.  ([#325](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/325))
* Fix the sdk not respecting the DefaultGetConfig when resolving the `ShouldIgnoreError` function.  ([#319](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/319))

_Bug fixes_
* Fix `requires hydrate data from xxxx but none is available` error  - avoid mutating Column objects, which may be shared between tables. ([#259](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/229))

## v2.0.0  [2022-02-04]
_Changed behaviour_
* A `_ctx` column is now added to all tables. This is a JSON field which specified the Steampipe connection name. ([#246](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/246))

_Bug fixes_
* Fix a query cache bug which under very specific circumstances would lead to an incomplete data set being returned. ([#254](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/254))

 ## v1.8.3  [2021-12-23]
_What's new_
* Updated `missing required quals` error to include table name. ([#166](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/166))

* Avoid adding duplicate quals to KeyColumnQualMap. Was causing invalid key column errors.  ([#236](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/236))

## v1.8.2  [2021-11-22]

_What's new_
* Query cache TTL defaults to 5 minutes and is increased to match the TTL of incoming queries. ([#226](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/226))
* Set cache cost of items based on number of rows and columns inserted. ([#227](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/227))
* Add logging for query cache usage. ([#229](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/229))

## v1.8.1  [2021-11-22]

* Remove unnecessary TableMapFunc validation from plugin - this breaks dynamic plugins when plugin manager is used. ([#204](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/204))

## v1.7.1  [2021-11-01]
_Bug fixes_

* Add `QueryStatus.RowsRemaining` function which performs context cancellation and limit checking to determine how much more data the plugin should provide. ([#177](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/177))
  * This function is used internally by StreamListItem to avoid calling hydrate functions once sufficient data has been returned. 
  * It may also be called directly by the plugin to avoid retrieving unneeded data from the external API
* Enable plugin table creation to use the connection config. New plugin property has been added: `TableMapFunc`. This can be set to a table creation function which, when invoked, has access to the parsed connection config. ([#180](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/180))

## v1.5.1  [2021-09-13]
_Bug fixes_
* Fix `get` call returning nothing if there is an `in` clause for the key column, and matrix parameters are used. ([#170](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/170))

## v1.5.0  [2021-08-06]
_What's new_ 
* Add cache functions `SetWithTTL` and `Delete`. ([#163](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/163))

_Bug fixes_
* When listing missing quals, only report required quals. ([#159](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/159))
## v1.4.1  [2021-07-20]
_Bug fixes_
* Extraneous log output removed

## v1.4.0  [2021-07-20]
_What's new_

## v1.3.0  [2021-07-09]

_What's new_
* When defining key columns it is now possible to specify supported operators for each column (defaulting to '='). ([#121](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/121))
* Add support for optional key columns. ([#112](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/112))
* Cancellation of GRPC stream is now reflected in the context passed to plugin operations, so plugins can easily handle cancellation by checking the context. ([#17](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/17))
* Add IsCancelled() function to simplify plugins checking for a cancelled context. ([#143](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/143))
* Add WithCache() function - if this is chained after a hydrate function definition, it enables plugin cache optimisation to avoid concurrent hydrate functions with same parameters. ([#116](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/116))

_Breaking changes_
* The property `QueryData.QueryContext.Quals` has been renamed to `QueryContext.UnsafeQuals`. This property contains all quals, not just key columns. These quals should not be used for filtering data as this may break the FDW row data caching, which is keyed based on key column quals. Instead, use the new property `QueryData.Quals`which contains only key column quals. ([#119](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/119))
* Plugins built with `v1.3` of the sdk will only be loaded by Steampipe `v0.6.2` onwards.

## v0.2.10 [2021-06-09]

* Fix EnsureStringArray transform not working for input type *string. closes #92 (#100)
* Fix Steampipe hanging after hydrate error. ([#103](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/103))
* Fix list call failing with error "get call requires an '=' qual". ([#103](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/103))

* Update `FromField` transform to accept multiple arguments, which are tried in order. ([#55](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/55))
* Add `ProtocolVersion` property to the plugin `GetSchema` response. ([#94](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/94))

## v0.2.7 [2021-03-31]
_Bug fixes_
* Multiregion queries should take region quals into account for 'get' calls. ([#78](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/78))

## v0.2.4 [2021-03-16]
_What's new_
* Include key column information in GetSchema response to support dynamic path key generation. ([#57](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/57))
* Make get calls with 'in' clauses asynchronous. ([#30](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/30))
* Remove need to call StreamLeafListItem for parent-child list calls. The child list function can now just cal StreamListItem. ([#64](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/64))
* For parent-child list calls, store the parent list call results in RowData `ParentItem` property so they can be accessed by hydrate functions. ([#65](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/65))

_Bug fixes_
* Queries with 'in' clause now work for list calls with required key columns. ([#61](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/61))
* For Get or List calls with required key columns and 'in' clauses, incorrect quals are passed to hydrate calls. ([#69](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk/issues/69))

## v0.2.3 [2021-03-02]
