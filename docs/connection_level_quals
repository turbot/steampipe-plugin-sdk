# Connection Level Quals

A plugin can register one or more columns which have a 1-1 mapping with Steampipe connection.
Then, when quals are included for these columns for an aggregator query, the plugin execution code can use these quals to filter the connection list which the query is executed against.

# ConnectionColumnValues
To implement this, the plugin must implement the function `ConnectionColumnValues`

```
func (p *plugin) ConnectionColumnValues(connection ) map[]string {
    return []string{"name"}
}
```
